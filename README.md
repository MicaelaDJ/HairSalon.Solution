#### _An MVC web application for a hair salon, Created 3/1/19, Updated 3/4/19, 3/5/19_

## Description

A program (using C#) that allows the owner of a salon to add a list of the stylists, and for each stylist, add clients who see that stylist. The stylists work independently, so each client only belongs to a single stylist.

## Specifications

* As a salon employee, I need to be able to see a list of all our stylists.
* As an employee, I need to be able to select a stylist, see their details, and see a list of all clients that belong to that stylist.
* As an employee, I need to add new stylists to our system when they are hired.
* As an employee, I need to be able to add new clients to a specific stylist.
* I should not be able to add a client if no stylists have been added.
